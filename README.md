BPMN Assistant is an application that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist with creating, editing, and
interpreting Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams.

cp .env.example .env
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

```
cd src\bpmn_assistant

    - [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart)
    - [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)
    - [Google AI Studio (Gemini) API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

## Core features

1. Diagram creation - Generates BPMN diagrams based on text descriptions.
2. Diagram editing - Modifies BPMN diagrams based on user input.
3. Diagram interpretation - Provides text descriptions of BPMN diagrams.
4. Drag-and-drop functionality - Users can drag and drop BPMN files (containing only supported elements) into the
   editor, then ask the LLM to edit or explain the process.

## Supported elements

The application currently supports a subset of BPMN elements:

* Task
* User task
* Service task
* Send task
* Receive task
* Business rule task
* Manual task
* Script task
* Exclusive gateway
* Parallel gateway
* Start event
* End event

## Limitations

* The AI assistant does not "see" manual edits made to the diagram. It always responds based on its last generated
  version. Keep this in mind when interacting with the assistant after making manual changes.
* Pools and lanes are not supported due to limitations in the [BPMN Auto Layout](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-auto-layout) library.
